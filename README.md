This game is inspired off of weddlegame.com. We wanted to keep playing after the daily puzzle, so we decided to build off of their concept.


Goal: 
    Recreate weddlegame.com beyond a daily puzzle 
    Look to expand data of players to include classics/legends, newer players, update players etc. 


Needs:
    A frontend to:
            select from a dropdown
            send POST to API (check if selection == puzzle_answer)
            based on API response, populate html table (with selection and colors)


    A backend to:
            provide random player from dataset [X]
            ...
